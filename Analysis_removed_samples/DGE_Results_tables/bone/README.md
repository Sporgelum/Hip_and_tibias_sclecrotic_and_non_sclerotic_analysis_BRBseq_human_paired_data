## Due to the samples combination, was not possible to use batch or patient in tibia vs hip, due to colinearity.  
  *batch means the Plate.ID  
  *patient means the patient ID  
  

### The comparison is just done using the condition and the fraction such as adipocyte and pellet as batch

**~batch + group**  
  *batch = svf or adipocyte  
  *group = hip or tibia
